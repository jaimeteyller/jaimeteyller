## 🚀 About Me

By day, I architect and lead engineering systems in the manufacturing world.
By night, I tinker with code, learn new tech, and sometimes pretend I'm a wizard with a keyboard.
My passions include being with my family, solving complex problems, optimizing systems, and the eternal quest for the perfect cup of coffee or tea.

## 😎 Fun Facts

- I believe every bug is just a misunderstood feature.
- Nowadays, coffee is one of my favorite dependencies — almost as essential as enjoying life itself (and I never let either run out).
- Forever searching for the perfect balance between living and continuous improvement.
- I take my code seriously, but not myself.
